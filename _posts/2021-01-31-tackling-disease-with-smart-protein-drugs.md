Doug obtained a PhD from University of Colorado Boulder in Biochemistry, and he is now the founder of BioLoomics, a synthetic biology startup with the aim of accelerating protein drug discovery through biosensor arrays and discovery partnerships. Taking a novel approach, BioLoomics aims to improve the success and lower the cost of traditional drug development.

Prior to founding BioLoomics, Doug was an integral team member in the DARPA Rapid Threat Assessment project at The University of Colorado, Boulder, where he gained expertise in proteomics, metabolomics, and phenotypic microscopy screening. He has also authored over 16 academic research publications.
