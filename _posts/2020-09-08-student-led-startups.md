Annabel studied Computer Science at Brown University, interned at Insight Venture Partners as a VC analyst and currently works as a Rotational Product Manager at Facebook. Eliana is studying Business and Psychology at Northeastern University. In the past, she co-founded a non-profit organisation, Golden Heroes, that creates and delivers chemotherapy kits to children with cancer across the US.

They've come together to create [Envision](https://www.envisionaccelerator.com/) -  a fully online accelerator for the next generation of diverse student founders.
