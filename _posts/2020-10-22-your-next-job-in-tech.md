Having graduated from Cambridge with a Double First Class Honours in Economics, Sam Franklin worked at Morgan Stanley as an investment banking analyst as well as McKinsey as a consultant. He then moved to Nested.com to head up the Business Operations team, which is where he met his cofounders for Otta.

Sam is currently the CEO of [Otta](https://otta.com/), an online platform which helps job seekers find roles at the world's most innovative companies. With their most recent pre-seed round led by LocalGlobe, a VC firm which focuses on impact investments, Otta provides bespoke job recommendations, tailored for each user, all from a simple survey which takes less than 5 minutes to complete. Otta has had an impressive 75,000+ candidate sign ups in the past year.
