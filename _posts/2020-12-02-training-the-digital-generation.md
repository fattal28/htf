Scott Vincent is the CEO and founder of [Digital Futures](https://digitalfutures.com/), a platform for graduates looking to enter the digital economy. Prior to starting this, Scott was recognised as one the U.K.'s Top 50 Entrepreneurs by The Telegraph for his first venture, Parker Fitzgerald, a risk management consultancy he started in 2009. With clients such as UBS, Credit Suisse and Citi Group, they were subsequently acquired by Accenture. After taking some time out to reconnect with his family, we caught up with Scott to learn more about his latest venture, Digital Futures.

Applications to join the 2021 Digital Futures Graduate Academy are now open. You can register on their [website](https://digitalfutures.com/).
