Taylor Nieman is the co-founder and CEO of Toucan. Having graduated from Cornell University, Taylor joined Headspace as an early employee in Strategic Partnerships. After that, she went on to work as Director of Business Development and Strategic Partnerships at Fair.com. She joins us today to talk about Toucan, the chrome extension which helps you learn a language. 



With their latest seed round led by GSV Ventures and other VC firms, along with angel investors such as Baron Davis, two-time NBA All-Star, and Jeff Weiner, former CEO of LinkedIn, Toucan (JoinToucan.com) is completely revolutionising the way we browse the web. It is a free Chrome extension which serves you up with micro-moments of learning as you browse the web, currently focused on teaching you a language. It's almost like a browser-based version of language flashcards, which integrates seamlessly into your everyday browsing.
