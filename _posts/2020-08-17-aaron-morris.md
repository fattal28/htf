Co-founder and CEO Aaron Morris completed his masters at Oxford university in Mathematics after which he joined Goldman Sachs as an analyst in London, trading equity derivatives with a focus on event-driven strategies.

Aaron then left the world of finance to start his first venture, [PostEra](https://postera.ai/), a bio-tech company that's been funded by the likes of Y Combinator and other top bay area investors. They use machine learning to accelerate the drug discovery process and have assembled a world class team from the likes of Harvard and Yale to tackle the problems surrounding this space.
