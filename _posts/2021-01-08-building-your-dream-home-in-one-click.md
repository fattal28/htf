Nick Donahue is the co-founder and CEO of [Atmos](https://www.buildatmos.com/), a Summer 2020 YC-backed company that provides an all in one platform to build the home of your dreams. With the aim of making building a house a one-click effort, Atmos intends to massively simplify the way homes are built, and in the process democratise customisation to more home owners.

With backing from Sam Altman, former YC president and now head of OpenAI, and Adam Nash, former president and CEO of Wealthfront, Atmos wants to take both the big decisions and the sundries of construction and combine them onto one platform where selecting a design and moving forward is as simple as clicking through a Shopify shopping cart.
